Userstyles for Google/Alphabet properties

This repository contains one or more userstyles for Google properties not associated with YouTube (GM_YT).

These userstyles are meant to improve usability by way of slightly modifying the design of desktop sites for smaller-resolution screens, including mobile devices. The rationale was, that some sites' desktop designs are more functional.

As of April 2017, the main userstyle is one for Blogger.
